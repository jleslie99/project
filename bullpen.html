            <p>The bullpen is group of pitchers that pitch after the starting pitcher has been taken out. These pitchers are called Relief Pitchers because they relieve the starting pitcher.
                Usually, these pitchers don't pitch more than 3 innings and some are even more specialized to pitch one inning or less.

                <p>Liam Hendriks was the biggest free agent signing in the 2020 offseason. He will be used as the closer in the bullpen.  
                    This means he usually will only pitch the last inning when we have a lead. This position specializes in high pressure situations and is often the biggest name in the bullpen.</p>

            <div class = "player-descr">
                <p>Aaron Bummer is one of the more underrated pitchers in the Sox bullpen. He has been very effective against left-handed batters in the last three years and will likely be the setup man.
                    This means he will often pitch in the 8th inning when the Sox have a lead.

                <p>Garrett Crochet was drafted in the 2020 draft and made headlines after pitching in the MLB in the same year. 
                    He can throw upwards of 100 mph from the left side and will be used in many different roles throughout the year.</p>

            <div class = "player-descr">
                <p>Codi Heur came seemingly out of nowhere last year to be a dominant force in the bullpen. 
                    He is an example of the White Sox ability to develop young relief pitchers and looks to improve on his impressive 2020 season.
