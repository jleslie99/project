            <h2>Recent History</h2>
            <p>The story behind this current group of players goes back to 2016. The Sox started the season very hot and expectations started to grow. 
                After the first month, the team steadily declined for pretty much the rest of the season</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jake Leslie and I've been a White Sox fan my entire life.  My entire family loves the team and we go to a lot of games each summer. 
                I played baseball in high school and my brothers play in college and high school currently, so we are very much a baseball family!</p>
