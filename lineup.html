        <div class = "intro">
            <p>The lineup consists of the position players on the roster. These are the players play defense out in the field and hit on offense. 
                There are 8 field positions that accompany the pitcher when a baseball team plays defense.</p>
            <p>On offense, if the team plays in the American League, which the White Sox do, they have a Designated Hitter (DH). 
                This player hits in place of the pitcher  and doesn't play in the field on defense. In the National League, however, pitchers hit and there is no DH.
                This page offers brief descriptions on the Sox starter at each postion in the lineup.</p>

                    He is an excelent and consistent hitter and is coming off of an MVP season in 2020. He is also regarded as one of the leaders of the clubhouse.</p>

            <div class = "player-descr">
                <p>Nick Madrigal was drafted in the first round of the 2018 draft by the White Sox. 
                    He is unique in today's game because he doesn't hit for a lot of power. His role on the team is to get on base a lot and play very good defense.</p>

                <p>The Sox traded for Moncada in 2016 when he was the number one prospect in all of baseball, signifying the beginning of "the rebuild."
                    He contracted COVID-19 before the 2020 season and struggled throughout the year in his recovery, but fans are hopeful he is back to full health for 2021.
                    When healthy, fans believe he can be the best player on the team.

                <p>Tim Anderson has emerged as a top player in the league in the last two seasons and is a cornerstone of this White Sox core. 
                    People were skeptical of his 2019 season where he led the league in batting average, but he effectively silenced his haters in 2020 with his similarly dominant year at the plate.</p>

            <div class = "player-descr">
                <p>Eloy Jimenez was acquired via trade from the Chicago Cubs as another intial move towards the rebuild. 
                    He struggles on the defensive side, but is one of the best hitters on the Sox. His ability to hit for power in all directions makes him special among all MLB players.</p>

                <p>Luis Robert entered the 2020 season as a top 3 prospect in all of baseball and is likely the best athlete on the team. He lived up to expectations aside for an extended cold streak towards the end of the year. 
                    He came in second for AL Rookie of the Year last year and fans are hopeful he will only improve in 2021.</p>

            <div class = "player-descr">
                <p>Adam Engel has been one of the best defensive outfielders in the league in the last two years. 
                    His hitting drastically improved in 2020 and earned him more playing time than his previous role as a defensive replacement. In 2021 he looks to start a majority of games in right field for the Sox</p>

            <div class = "player-descr">
                <p>Andrew Vaughn was selected third overall in the 2019 MLB Draft. He has not had a typical minor league career because of COVID-19, but is still expected to start the year in the majors.
                    He was regarded as the best and most mature hitters in his draft class and the team expects him to perform well, despite his lack of minor league experience.
