            <p>The starting rotation consists of the starting pitchers on the roster. This is usually a rotation of 5 pitchers. Each pitcher starts one game and then will rest for the next four.
                This is because they throw close to 100 pitches in those outings, so they require a lot of rest.

                <p>Dylan Cease was aquired from the Chicago Cubs as a prospect. 
                    His results have been mixed in his brief career that starting in 2019, but has made changes going into 2021. He is hopeful to build on his potential this year.

                <p>Rodon has been with the team for around 5 years now, but has struggled with injuries throughout his career. 
                    When healthy he is a very solid left-handed starter, so Sox fans are hopeful he can contribute for the whole season in 2021.</p>
